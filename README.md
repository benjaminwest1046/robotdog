# robotdog

This repo is for a simple robot dog that was made by myself and Jamie King during a Nodebot meetup. We had approximately one day to hookup our environment, put together a robot and program it to do something sweet. 

The following hardware was used on the project: 
* Arduino Uno
* 4 servos (for leg movement)
* A couple leds (for eyes)
* Popsicle stickets (for the body)

Software Used: 
* Arduino/StandardFirmata (For communicating with microcontroller)
* JohnnyFive (nodebot library)
* Node.js

All in all I think we did pretty well for a half a day build. Our dog is slightly...special, but it works and it was great to see Javascript powering something in real life!
